# Documentation

It was required to create a **responsive** website or a web app which aimed to solve a real word problem.

As it was the student's choice to choose the subject of the website I decided to create a website with the
intention to promote an athlete. The website presents a lot of data that is stored in tables and graph, therefore the desktop version was the priority when it was being developed.

### 1.1.1 Background

As a fan of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I decided to create a website to promote and showcase the accomplishments of one my favourite athletes in the sport.
Like all sports, brazilian jiu-jitsu is a constant evolving art in which new upcoming athletes appear all the time, therefore
I found that it was necessary to create a webpage that documented all of the triumphs and tribulations throughout André Galvão's.

Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is a very complex and technical sport that incorporates terms that are not very common to the spectator, however this was kept in mind
and all of these expressions or specific names, are explained, so every user can understand.

**CREATE WIRE FRAMES**

### Colour Choices

The main color used for this project is blue for a couple of reasons, the first one being the team that the athlete represents has the color blue in it's logo, and many of the pictures used in this website were found in the athlete's team page (https://atosjiujitsuhq.com/) , another reason for blue to be the color of the website is, that in the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu the "clothing" used in competition is mainly **white** and these are both fresh, cool colors that mix well with each other and give the user a satisfying browsing experience.

The last reason to pick blue was simply because it is a color that users are used to see in the internet world, there is a number of famous websites (facebook,twitter,outlook,steam) that use blue as their main color and that gives the user, in some manner, the sense of familiarity, security and trustworthiness, in order to not bore the user during his visit, tones of grey and white are used throughout the project.

### Accessibility

As this is an informative website, it is fundamental to display the information in a dynamic, and easy way in order to present it in a way that makes sense to the user.
There were kept in mind various disabilities that a user can have while browsing the website:
