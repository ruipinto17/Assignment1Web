# Documentation

It was required to create a responsive website or a web app which aimed to solve a real word problem.

As it was the student's choice to choose the subject of the website I decided to create a website with the
intention to promote/showcase an athlete. The website presents a lot of data that organized in a table and blocks of text, therefore the desktop version was the priority when it was being developed.


### 1.1.1 Background

As a fan of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, I decided to create a website to promote and showcase the accomplishments of one my favourite athletes in the sport.
Like all sports, brazilian jiu-jitsu is a constant evolving art in which new upcoming athletes appear all the time, therefore
I found that it was necessary to create a website that documented all of the triumphs and tribulations throughout André Galvão's career.

The problem I found when I started to develop the website was finding bits of information, in a variety of websites, so the main goal was to collect all that data and display it in one single website, so we could get an accurate and continuous view of the information about the athlete.

### 1.1.2 Wire Frames

Wire frames were created and included into a folder inside the project's folder

### 1.1.3 Colour Choices

The main color used for this project is blue for a couple of reasons, the first one being the team that the athlete represents has the color blue in it's logo, and many of the pictures used in this website were found in the athlete's team page (https://atosjiujitsuhq.com/) , another reason for blue to be the color of the website is, that in the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu the "clothing" used in competition is mainly **white** and these are both fresh, cool colors that mix well with each other and give the user a satisfying browsing experience.

The last reason to pick blue was simply because it is a color that users are used to see in the internet world, there is a number of famous websites (facebook,twitter,outlook,steam) that use blue as their main color and that gives the user, in some manner, the sense of familiarity, security and trustworthiness, in order to not bore the user during his visit, tones of grey and white are used throughout the project.

### 1.1.4 Accessibility

As this is an informative website, it is fundamental to display the information in a dynamic, and easy way in order to present it in a way that makes sense to the user.
After doing some research it was possible to find some information about accessibility on the internet, and some measures were taken into consideration:

- Even though it doesn't work as intended, the project as a mobile version that allows the user to access and browse the website in a smaller display, i.e.: phone, tablet
- Throughout the development of the website 95% of the testing was performed in Google Chrome, despite being the most famous and used browser world-wide other browsers are still used,
and for that, some compatibility measures were taken to make sure the content is displayed in a clear way in every browser, however, despite researching I wasn't able to find a solution for all of them.
- Considering hardware difficulties, it is possible to navigate through the website either using just a mouse or just a keyboard.

### 1.2.5 GDPR

As the goal of website is to inform his users about the career of Andre Galvao, no new data was created, only a compilation of various informations and statistics were combined into a single platform.

All of the information used in the project was found in the internet including Andre's academy website (https://atosjiujitsuhq.com), therefore his privacy was kept the same as all the information that was used was already on the internet before.

### 1.2.6 Distance Selling

The website's goal is not to sell anything, however it is Andre's website is promoted multiple times in the project

### 1.2.5 Evaluation

Taking a look at the evaluation of the project overall, I would say I was able to manage the main goal of the website as it is possible to learn basically all the path of Andre's career, however i do not display all of his matches as it would just take too much time inserting all the data.

There were some problems along the way, the main one being displaying the data correctly while in mobile mode, a part from that, when the project initially started I was meant to include a pie chart displaying more data about Andre's matches but I didn't manage to style it how I wanted it in time, therefore I had to exclude it from the project,  It is also notable that some animations don't work in another browsers.

Like it was mentioned previously, most of the testing was made in google chrome, however I tested the website in other browsers aswell and managed to find a way to display the effects on the Info page, unfortunately older versions of Internet Explorer don't support the carousel effect.

My design choices, were pretty simple, the colors basically represent the team represents and the display of the website follows a simple design that aims to show the data in a concise way, I took the idea from the navigation bar, Andre's website.

It is important to note, that I followed various tutorials and did a big amount of research in some of the effects that were used on the website, per example: the navigation bar I took the idea from an online tutorial which I later customized for my own website, the carousel of pictures I took the idea from (https://www.w3schools.com) and the text effect over the images was also a tutorial found online, however all of these were very customized to match the dynamic of the website and my own taste.
