                <p>André Galvão was born September 29, 1982 in São Sebastião, São Paulo – Brazil.</p><p></p>

                <p>The Galvão family moved to Vale da Paraíba region when André was a child, and it was there that he initiated his martial arts education through judo. Calasans Camargo, father to ADCC champion Claudio Calasans, became involved in André’s judo life from early on having gifted Galvão his very first gi (kimono).</p><p>                                                <p></p>
                
                <p>André initiated his jiu jitsu career influenced by his brother who was already a BJJ student. Luis Carlos Dagmar, was André Galvão’s first coach in this discipline. Careca, who himself was a former student of the Osvaldo Alves, soon realised André’s talent and advised him to go and train with Fernando Tererê.</p>

                <p>Galvão was only 16 years old at the time (two years into his training), but Dagmar believed André’s special talent would be better served in a more competitive environment, considering his own academy as too small for André’s future.</p>                
        </div>
        <div id="three">
            <p>Under the guidance of Tererê, André Galvão’s skills evolved leaps and bounds. Fernando was one of the sport’s main competitors at the time, a world champion and a Pound for Pound 
                best in the early 2000’s. Galvão would follow Terere, during a time span of almost 3 years where he remained undefeated in the purple belt division. During this period André was the first purple belt ever to win the IBJJF ‘Grand Slam’ (World Championship, Pan American Championship, and Brazilian Nationals).</p>

            <p>After 9 victorious months as a purple belt André received his his brown belt from Fernando. As a brown belt the victorious run continued, with only one loss, to Ricardo Abreu in the absolute division of the Copa do Brasil.</p>

            <p>André Galvão was due to receive his black belt in mid 2005, unfortunately this clashed with a series of incidents that turned Tererê’s attention away from jiu jitsu. With Fernando absent from the sport, Terere’s right hand man and TT partner Eduardo Telles drove Galvão to the town where he grew up, so André could have the honour of receiving his black belt from his original instructor, Master Luis Dagmar.</p>

            <p>As Tererê left the sport due to well documented personal problems, André Galvão ended leaving his team (TT) to join Brasa Clube de Jiu Jitsu.</p>

        <div id="four">

            <p>Throughout his early career Galvão believed in consistency and repetition, and unlike most top competitors, he dedicated himself to fighting in all tournaments, not just the major ones. He often mentioned that he relied on this to keep improving his skill set.</p>

            <p>On October 2008 Galvão joined his good friend Ramon Lemos and founded a new jiu jitsu team. The pair had a strong evangelic background (André is also a deacon) and brought their religious beliefs to the mats, calling their name Atos (acts) as in the Acts of the Apostles book.</p>

            <p>Having turned into a professional MMA fighter in 2008, Galvão fought in some of the world’s top promotions, including DREAM (Japan) and Strikeforce (USA). He left Strikeforce by his own accord after a good year (2010). At the time he had plans to join The Ultimate Fighter TV show (as explained on his intervirew to BJJ Heroes on January 2010), though the plans did not follow through.</p>

            <p>André Galvão returned to jiu jitsu competitions on March 7 2010, winning the Abu Dhabi Pro trials in San Diego, California (under 183lbs), winning also the Pan American a few weeks later – submitting all his opponents, except Eduardo Santoro in the final.</p>

            <p>After moving to San Diego with his spouse Angelica Galvão (also an active competitor), Andre became the head coach of Atos head quarters while also picking up a position as a deacon in an evangelical church, Project New Life.</p>
